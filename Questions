If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

margin, and as you move along with more tags in that current tag, the heirarchy continues in a downward motion.


Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

1: display: block; takes up the entire width of the row. Display: inline; only takes up the amount needed. For example,

p {
    display: block;
}

will generate... 

------------------------- <p> ----------------------------
------------------------- <p> ---------------------------- ...

however,

p {
    display: inline;
}

will generate...

<p> <p> ...

2: Another difference is that block will always start on a new line while inline will allow multiple in one line
